The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on [[darknet]]s: overlay networks that use the [[Internet]] but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. 

Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location. 

The dark web forms a small part of the [[Deep web]], the part of the web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term [[Deep web]] is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.

The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend networks, as well as large, popular networks such as [[Tor]], [[Freenet]], [[I2P]], and [[Riffle]] operated by public organizations and individuals. 

Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.
