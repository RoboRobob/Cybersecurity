## The role of [[framework]]s and controls in audits

Along with compliance, it’s important to mention the role of frameworks and controls in security audits. Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the international standard for information security (ISO 27000) series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits. Additionally, frameworks, when used alongside controls, can support organizations’ ability to align with regulatory compliance requirements and standards. 

There are three main categories of controls to review during an audit, which are **administrative and/or managerial**, **technical**, and **physical controls**.
## Audit checklist
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

Identify the scope of the audit
    The audit should:
        - List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
        - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
        - Indicate how often an audit should be performed
        - Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees

Complete a risk assessment
    - A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).

Conduct the audit
    - When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.

Create a mitigation plan
    - A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 

Communicate results to stakeholders
    - The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
