1. **Security and risk management** focuses on defining security goals and objectives,
risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law.

Example Security and Risk Managament Attack
	 **Social engineering attack**
	**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:
	- [[Phishing]]
	- [[Smishing]]   
	- [[Vishing]]
	- [[Spear phishing]]
	- [[Whaling]]
	- [[Social media phishing]]
	- Business Email Compromise (BEC)
	- [[Watering hole attack]]
	- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting
	- Physical [[social engineering]]

2. **Asset security**.
This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets.
It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and
destruction of data.
Example Asset Security attack
	 **Physical attack**
	A **physical attack** is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:
	-Card cloning and skimming
	-Malicious USB cable
	-Malicious flash drive

3. **Security architecture and engineering**.
This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools,
systems, and processes are in place.

4. **communication and network security.**
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and
wireless communications

communication and network security attacks: 
Password attack
	A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  
	- [[Brute force]]
	- [[Rainbow table]]
Cryptographic attack:
		**[[Cryptographic attack]]**
		A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 
		- [[Birthday]]
		- [[Collision]]
		- [[Downgrade]]
		[[Cryptographic attack]]s fall under the communication and network security domain.

5. **Identity and access management**
focuses on keeping data secure, by
ensuring users follow established policies
to control and manage physical assets,
like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications
Example Identity and access management attack:
	**Adversarial artificial intelligence**
	
	**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning)
	
	technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

6. **security assessment and testing.**
This domain focuses on conducting security control testing,
collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for
risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

7. **security operations.**
This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures

Example Security operations attack:
	**Supply-chain attack**
	A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, [[Hardware]], and/or software to locate a vulnerability where [[Malware]] can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains.

8. **software development security.** 
This domain focuses on using secure coding practices,
which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used
to create secure applications and services.
