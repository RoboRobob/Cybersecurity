    Security guards
    Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
    Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:
    Firewalls
    MFA
    Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:
    Separation of duties
    Authorization
    Asset classification
