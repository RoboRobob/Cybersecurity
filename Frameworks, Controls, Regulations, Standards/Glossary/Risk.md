A **risk** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc. 

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:

- **External risk:** Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information
- **Internal risk:** A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk
- **Legacy systems:** Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.
- **Multiparty risk:** Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
- **Software compliance/licensing:** Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner

There are many resources, such as the [[NIST]], that provide lists of [cybersecurity risks](https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/cybersecurity-basics/cybersecurity-risks)

. Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project ([[OWASP]]) publishes a standard awareness document about the [top 10 most critical security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to web applications, which is updated regularly.

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity  
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **Transference**: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **Mitigation**: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 

Examples of [[Security framework]]s commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework ([[NIST RMF]]) and Health Information Trust Alliance ([[HITRUST]]).
