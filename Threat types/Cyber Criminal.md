[[Cybercrime]] is a type of crime involving a computer or a computer network. The [[computer]] may have been used in committing the crime, or it may be the target. [[Cybercrime]] may harm someone's security or finances.

Internationally, both state and non-[[State actors]] engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and involving the actions of at least one nation-state are sometimes referred to as [[cyberwarfare]]. Warren Buffett describes [[cybercrime]] as the "number one problem with mankind"[7] and said that it "poses real risks to humanity".

A 2014 report sponsored by McAfee estimated that [[cybercrime]] had resulted in $445 billion USD in annual damage to the global economy. Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and debit card fraud in the US. In 2018, a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership with McAfee, concluded that nearly 1 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), close to $600 billion, is lost to [[cybercrime]] each year. The World Economic Forum 2020 Global Risk Report confirmed that organized [[cybercrime]] groups are joining forces to commit criminal activities online, while estimating the likelihood of their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the US.[12] There are also many privacy concerns surrounding [[cybercrime]] when confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, legally or otherwise.
Classifications

Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities, including computer fraud, financial crimes, scams, cybersex trafficking, and ad fraud.
Computer fraud
Main article: Computer fraud

Computer fraud is the act of using a computer to take or alter electronic data, or to gain unlawful use of a computer or system.[15] If computer fraud involves the use of the [[internet]], it can be considered [[Internet]] fraud. The legal definition of computer fraud varies by jurisdiction, but typically involves accessing a computer without permission or authorization.

Forms of computer fraud include hacking into computers to alter information, distributing malicious code such as computer worms or viruses, installing [[Malware]] or spyware to steal data, phishing, and advance-fee scams.[16]

Other forms of fraud may be committed using computer systems, including bank fraud, carding, identity theft, extortion, and theft of classified information. These types of crimes often result in the loss of personal or financial information.
Cyberterrorism
Main article: Cyberterrorism

Cyberterrorism are acts of terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer resources.[17] Acts of disruption of computer networks and personal computers through viruses, worms, phishing, malicious software, [[Hardware]], or programming scripts can all be forms of cyberterrorism.[18]

Government officials and information technology (IT) security specialists have documented a significant increase in network problems and [[Server]] scams since early 2001. Within the United States, there is an increasing concern from agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Such incidents are part of an organized effort by cyberterrorist foreign intelligence services or other groups to map potential security flaws in critical systems.[19]
Cyberextortion

Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail [[Server]], or computer system is subjected to or threatened with attacks by malicious hackers, such as denial-of-service attacks. Cyberextortionists demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to offer "protection". According to the FBI, cyberextortionists are increasingly attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their ability to operate, and demanding payments to restore their service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI, and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of the public domain. Perpetrators use a distributed denial-of-service attack.[20] However, other cyberextortion techniques exist, such as doxing, extortion, and bug poaching. An example of cyberextortion was the Sony Hack of 2014.[21]
Ransomware
Main article: Ransomware

[[Ransomware]] is a type of [[Malware]] used in cyberextortion to restrict access to files, sometimes threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid. The threat of ransomware is a global issue, with more than 300 million attacks worldwide in 2021. According to the 2022 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report, the average ransom demand in cases handled by Norton climbed 144 percent to $2.2 million. This report included an 85 percent increase in the number of victims who had their personal information shown on dark web information dumps.[22] A loss of nearly $400 million in 2021 and 2022 is just one of the statistics showing the impact of ransomware attacks on everyday people.[23]
Cybersex trafficking
Main article: Cybersex trafficking

Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims and then the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam.[24][25][26][27] Victims are abducted, threatened, or deceived and transferred to "cybersex dens".[28][29][30] The dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have a computer, tablet, or phone with an [[internet]] connection.[26] Perpetrators use social media networks, video conferences, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites,[31] and other platforms.[32] They use online payment systems[31][33][34] and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities.[35] Millions of reports of its occurrence are sent to authorities annually.[36] New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this type of [[cybercrime]].[37]

There are an estimated 6.3 million victims of cybersex trafficking, according to a recent report by the International Labour Organization and IOM.[38][39] This number includes about 1.7 million child victims. An example of cybersex trafficking is the 2018–2020 Nth room case in South Korea.[40]
Cyberwarfare
Main article: Cyberwarfare

The U.S. Department of Defense notes that cyberspace has emerged as a national-level concern through several recent events of geostrategic importance, including the attack on Estonia's infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by Russian hackers. In August 2008, Russia again allegedly conducted cyberattacks, this time in a coordinated and synchronized kinetic and non-kinetic campaign against the country of Georgia. Fearing that such attacks may become normalized in future warfare among nation-states, the military commanders intend to adapt the concept of cyberspace operations impact in the future.[41]
Computer as a tool
Main articles: [[Internet]] fraud, [[Spam]]ming, [[Phishing]], and Carding (fraud)

When the individual is the main target of [[cybercrime]], the computer can be considered as the tool rather than the target. These crimes generally involve less technical expertise. Human weaknesses are generally exploited. The damage dealt is largely psychological and intangible, making legal action against the variants more difficult. These are the crimes which have existed for centuries in the offline world. Scams, theft, and the like existed before the development of computers and the [[internet]]. The same criminal has simply been given a tool which increases their potential pool of victims and makes them all the harder to trace and apprehend.[42]

Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other ends include:

Fraud and identity theft (although this increasingly uses [[Malware]], hacking or phishing, making it an example of both "computer as target" and "computer as tool" crime)
Information warfare
Phishing scams
Spam
Propagation of illegal obscene or offensive content, including harassment and threats

The unsolicited sending of bulk email for commercial purposes (spam) is unlawful in some jurisdictions.

Phishing is mostly propagated via [[email]]. Phishing emails may contain links to other websites that are affected by [[Malware]].[43] Or they may contain links to fake online banking or other websites used to steal private account information.
Obscene or offensive content

The content of websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, obscene, or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some instances, these communications may be illegal.

The extent to which these communications are unlawful varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs.

One area of [[internet]] pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography, which is illegal in most jurisdictions in the world.

[[Ad-fraud]]
See also: Ad fraud and Click fraud

Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals, as such frauds are lucrative and less likely to be prosecuted.[44] Jean-Loup Richet, a professor at the Sorbonne Business School, classified the large variety of ad-fraud committed by cybercriminals into three categories: identity fraud, attribution fraud, and ad-fraud services.[14]

Identity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate audience numbers. Several ad-fraud techniques relate to this category and include traffic from bots (coming from a hosting company or a [[data center]], or from compromised devices); cookie stuffing; falsifying user characteristics, such as location and browser type; fake social traffic (misleading users on social networks into visiting the advertised website); and the creation of fake social media accounts to make the bot appear legitimate.

Attribution fraud impersonates the activities of real users, such as clicks and conversations. Multiple ad-fraud techniques belong to this category: hijacked devices and the use of infected users (through [[Malware]]) as part of a botnet to participate in ad fraud campaigns; click farms (companies where low-wage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations and affiliates' offers); incentivized browsing; video placement abuse (delivered in display banner slots); hidden ads (which will never be viewed by real users); domain spoofing (ads served on a website other than the advertised real-time bidding website); and clickjacking, in which the user is forced to click on an ad.

Ad fraud services are related to all online infrastructure and hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or attribution fraud. Services can involve the creation of spam websites (fake networks of websites created to provide artificial backlinks); link building services; hosting services; creation of fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand and used as part of an ad fraud campaign.
Online harassment

The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this section, discuss the issue on the talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)

Whereas content may be offensive in a non-specific way, harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on gender, race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation.

There are instances when committing a crime using a computer can lead to an enhanced sentence. For example, in the case of United States v. Neil Scott Kramer, the defendant was given an enhanced sentence according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §2G1.3(b)(3) for his use of a cell phone to "persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct." Kramer appealed the sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under this statute because his charge included persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue this point, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that the term "computer" means "an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device."

In the United States, over 41 states have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online harassment as a criminal act. These acts can be punished on a federal scale, such as US Code 18 Section 2261A, which states that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a sentence of up to 20 years, depending on the action taken.[45]

Several countries outside the United States have also created laws to combat online harassment. In China, a country that supports over 20 percent of the world's [[internet]] users, the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict law against the bullying of young people through a bill in response to the Human Flesh Search Engine.[46][47] The United Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act, among other acts from 1997 to 2013, which stated that sending messages or letters electronically that the government deemed "indecent or grossly offensive" and/or language intended to cause "distress and anxiety" can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a potentially large fine.[48][49]  Australia, while not directly addressing the issue of harassment, has grouped the majority of online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of 1995. Using telecommunication to send threats or harass and cause offense was a direct violation of this act.[50]

Although freedom of speech is protected by law in most democratic societies (in the US this is done by the First Amendment), it does not include all types of speech. In fact, spoken or written "true threat" speech or text is criminalized because of "intent to harm or intimidate". That also applies to online or network-related threats in written text or speech.

Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing popularity of online social networking. As of January 2020, 44 percent of adult [[internet]] users in the United States have "personally experienced online harassment".[51] Children who experience online harassment deal with negative and sometimes life-threatening side effects. In 2021, reports displayed 41 percent of children developing social anxiety, 37 percent of children developing depression, and 26 percent of children having suicidal thoughts.[52]

The United Arab Emirates was named in a spying scandal where the Gulf nation along with other repressive governments purchased NSO Group's mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance. Prominent activists and journalists were targeted as part of the campaign, including Ahmed Mansoor, Princess Latifa, Princess Haya, and more. Ghada Oueiss was one of the many high-profile female journalists and activists who became the target of online harassment. Oueiss filed a lawsuit against UAE ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants, accusing them of sharing her photos online. The defendants, including the UAE ruler, filed motions to dismiss the case of the hack-and-leak attack.[53]
