CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) is an independent information security certification granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, also known as ISC2.

As of March, 2023 there are 159,679 ISC2 members holding the CISSP certification worldwide.

In June 2004, the CISSP designation was accredited under the ANSI ISO/IEC Standard 17024:2003. It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense ([[DoD]]) in their Information Assurance Technical (IAT), Managerial (IAM), and System Architect and Engineer (IASAE) categories for their DoD 8570 certification requirement.

In May 2020, The UK National Academic Recognition Information Centre assessed the CISSP qualification as a Level 7 award, **the same level as a Masters degree**. The change enables cyber security professionals to use the CISSP certification towards further higher education course credits and also opens up opportunities for roles that require or recognize masterâ€™s degrees.
