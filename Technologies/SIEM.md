Security information and event management (SIEM) is a field within the field of computer security, where software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). 

They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. Vendors sell SIEM as [[software]], as appliances, or as managed services; these products are also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance purposes.

The term and the initialism SIEM was coined by Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005.
