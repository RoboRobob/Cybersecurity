A Physical Server is what truly serves data in the end. Operating on metal and electricity, modern physical servers are often capable of serving far more than one user could ever want.

These are typically housed in [[Data Center]]s by hosting companies to serve a variety of clients. The only exception would be larger organizations who rely on these; in these cases, the organizations usually own the network of physical servers.

In the past, each server in a network (e.g Webserver, Database Server etc) was hosted on its own dedicated physical server. This concept is now being replaced with [[Virtualization]] technologies whereby each server can be a virtual machine inside a bigger physical machine.
