A web proxy server can run on one of many protocols, but they all do one thing in common.

They take in user requests, filter them, and then act on the user’s behalf. The most popular type of web proxy server is designed to get around school and organizational web filters.

Because web traffic is all through one IP address and website that isn’t yet blocked, users can gain access to sites that are forbidden through these filters.

The less popular type is an organizational proxy server. This has the same effect, but it’s typically authorized by an organization.

It takes users’ web traffic, usually logs it for evaluation later, and sends it to the Internet.

This puts users’ traffic all together so that one computer cannot be differentiated publicly from another.

This is done intentionally by an organization to prevent users from being targeted and usually to be able to inspect, cache and analyze packets sent and received.
