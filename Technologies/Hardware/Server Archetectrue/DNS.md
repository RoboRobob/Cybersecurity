A DNS server, or “Domain Name Service” server, is used to [translate domain names](https://www.networkstraining.com/what-is-dns/) to their corresponding IP addresses.

This server is what your browser references when you type in a domain name and press Enter. The idea is that users don’t have to memorize IP addresses and organizations can have a fitting name.

Typically, [[Internet]] Service Providers (ISPs) provide DNS servers to their users. However, there are many organizations that provide this lookup service for free, as well (such as the popular Google DNS server with IP 8.8.8.8).

Some users who are more concerned about their privacy on the web often use these alternate DNS servers.

DNS servers are also tapped when users create a new domain name. DNS servers operate on a hierarchical basis, so there are some more “authoritative” servers than others.

The domain name is registered with one higher-up DNS server that other, lower-level DNS servers reference. Usually through a process taking anywhere from 24 to 48 hours, this registration propagates across the world.

**Ports used for DNS Servers**: Port 53 (both TCP and UDP).
