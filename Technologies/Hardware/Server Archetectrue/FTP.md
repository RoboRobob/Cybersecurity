A File Server is different from an FTP server. This type of server is more modern and is typically capable of “mapping” networked files onto drives. This means that users can use their home computer’s file browser to look into folders.

The main advantage of this form of server is that users can upload and download shared files. Permissions to files are controlled by the administrator.

Usually File Servers exist in corporate networks in a Windows [[Active Directory]] environment or in [[Linux]] environments
