An email server typically runs on “SMTP” or “Simple Mail Transfer Protocol”. There are other possible protocols that newer mail servers operate on, but SMTP remains the dominant protocol.

An email server powers mail services. These servers in themselves simply take in emails from one client to another and forward the data to the other server.

Data is simplified when sent through SMTP, so some information, like web formatting, is usually lost in email transactions.

The modern approach to email servers typically pairs them with web servers. This allows for users to have a “web client” that graphically shows the data on a web page. Some newer web applications can even mimic a home computer email client without installing anything.
