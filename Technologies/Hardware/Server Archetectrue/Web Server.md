Web servers simply take “GET” and “POST” requests from clients (among other verbs).

A “GET” request is when a client simply wants to retrieve information and doesn’t have any information to submit to the server.

A “POST” request on the other hand is when a client _does_ have information to share with the server and expects a response back. For example, filling up a form on a web server and clicking the submit button is a “POST” request from the client to the server.

Web servers are typically “headless” in nature. This is to preserve the memory on the server and ensure that there’s enough to power the operating system and applications on the server.

“[[Headless]]” means that it doesn’t run like a traditional home computer, but rather just serves content. The administrators of these servers can only connect to them through command line terminals.

Remember that these types of servers can run any type of application just like your home computer can.

They can also run on any operating system, as long as they obey the general “rules” of the web.

Modern web applications usually run on a series of layers, starting with server-side scripts and programs that process data (e.g PHP, ASP.NET etc), and ending with client-side scripting (e.g Javascript) that programs how the data should be displayed.
