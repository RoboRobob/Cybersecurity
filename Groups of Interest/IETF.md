[IETF Website](https://www.ietf.org/)
The [[Internet]] Engineering Task Force (IETF), founded in 1986, is the premiere standards development organization (SDO) for the [[Internet]]. The IETF makes voluntary standards that are often adopted by [[Internet]] users, network operators, and equipment vendors, and it thus helps shape the trajectory of the development of the [[Internet]]. But in no way does the IETF control, or even patrol, the [[Internet]].

"the overall goal of the IETF is to make the [[Internet]] work better."
"Its mission is to produce high quality, relevant technical and engineering documents that influence the way people design, use, and manage the [[Internet]] in such a way as to make the [[Internet]] work better. These documents include protocol standards, best current practices, and informational documents of various kinds."

There is no membership in the IETF. Anyone can participate by signing up to a working group [[mailing list]] (more on that below), or registering for an IETF meeting. All IETF participants are considered volunteers and expected to participate as individuals, including those paid to participate.

The IETF welcomes all interested individuals and participants come from all over the world and from many different parts of the Internet industry. In any one year, over 7000 people actively participate in the IETF either by authoring a document, engaging in a mailing list discussion, or attending a meeting.

The only fee the IETF charges is for registering for an IETF meeting, with options in place to prevent that fee from becoming a barrier to participation.

IETF participants are regularly shown the [Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/), a reminder of the policies and processes they are expected to comply with. To ensure an environment in which people of many different backgrounds are treated with dignity, decency, and respect, these policies include a [code of conduct](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp54), an [anti-harassment policy](https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-anti-harassment-policy), and the IETF has an [Ombudsteam](https://www.ietf.org/contact/ombudsteam) who are the point of escalation for any problems with conduct.

The IETF publishes its technical documentation as RFCs, an acronym for their historical title _Requests for Comments_. RFCs are sequentially numbered, starting with RFC 1 published in 1969 (the RFC series predates the IETF). Each RFC has a status, generally one of 'Internet Standard', 'Proposed Standard', 'Best Current Practice' (or 'BCP' in short), 'Informational', 'Experimental' or 'Historic'. Some statuses may change over time. RFCs are freely available.

The RFC series has two sub-series, STDs and BCPs, with each numbered [[STD]] and [[BCP]] comprising one or more RFCs. STDs are 'Internet Standard' RFCs and BCPs are RFCs that describe Best Current Practices in the Internet, some of which are administrative processes for the IETF.

Once an [[RFC]] is published, it is never revised. If the specification it describes changes, the standard will be re-published in another RFC that "obsoletes" the first. If a technical or editorial error is found in an [[RFC]], an errata may be linked to the [[RFC]] and/or held for the next document update.

The authoritative repository of RFCs is the [RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org) website.
