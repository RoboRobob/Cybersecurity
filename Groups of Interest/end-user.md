Anyone who uses computer technology at a basic level.

ie: employees, [[internet]] users

[[RFC]] document explaining the [[IETF]]'s definition:

End users are not necessarily a homogenous group; they might have different views of how the [[Internet]] should work and might occupy several roles, such as a seller, buyer, publisher, reader, service provider, and consumer. 

An end user might browse the [[Web]], monitor remote equipment, play a game, videoconference with colleagues, send messages to friends, or perform an operation in a remote surgery theater. They might be "at the keyboard" or represented by software indirectly (e.g., as a daemon). Likewise, an individual end user might have many interests (e.g., privacy, security, flexibility, reachability) that are sometimes in tension.
