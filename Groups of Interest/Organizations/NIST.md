[Cybersecurity Branch](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity)
Part of the US Department of Commerce

**The National Institute of Standards and Technology** (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk.

They oversee many different subjects in science, tech, and commerce, but we are most interested in the cybersecurity branch and to that end they have this to say:

NIST develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines, best practices, and other resources to meet the needs of U.S. industry, federal agencies and the broader public. Our activities range from producing specific information that organizations can put into practice immediately to longer-term research that anticipates advances in technologies and future challenges.

Some NIST cybersecurity assignments are defined by federal statutes, executive orders and policies. 

For example, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates that all federal agencies implement NIST’s cybersecurity standards and guidance for non-national security systems. Our cybersecurity activities also are driven by the needs of U.S. industry and the broader public. We engage vigorously with stakeholders to set priorities and ensure that our resources address the key issues that they face. 

NIST also advances understanding and improves the management of privacy risks, some of which relate directly to cybersecurity.

Priority areas to which NIST contributes – and plans to focus more on – include cryptography, education and workforce, emerging technologies, risk management, identity and access management, measurements, privacy, trustworthy networks and trustworthy platforms.
