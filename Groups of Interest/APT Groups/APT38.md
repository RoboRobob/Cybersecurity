Lazarus Group (also known by other monikers such as Guardians of Peace or Whois Team) is a cybercrime group made up of an unknown number of individuals run by the government of North Korea. 

While not much is known about the Lazarus Group, researchers have attributed many cyberattacks to them between 2010 and 2021. 

Originally a criminal group, the group has now been designated as an advanced persistent threat due to intended nature, threat, and wide array of methods used when conducting an operation. 

Names given by cybersecurity organizations include Hidden Cobra (used by the United States Department of Homeland Security to refer to malicious cyber activity by the North Korean government in general) and Zinc (by [[Microsoft]]).

The Lazarus Group has strong links to North Korea. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation says that the Lazarus Group is allegedly a North Korean "state-sponsored hacking organization". According to North Korean defector Kim Kuk-song, the unit is internally known in North Korea as 414 Liaison Office.

## Attributed Attacks:
## May 2017 [[WannaCry]] ransomware attack

The [[WannaCry]] attack was a massive ransomware cyberattack that hit institutions across the globe ranging all the way from the NHS in Britain, to Boeing, and even to Universities in China on the 12th of May, 2017. 

The attack lasted 7 hours and 19 minutes. Europol estimates it affected nearly 200,000 computers in 150 countries, primarily affecting Russia, India, Ukraine, and Taiwan. This was one of the first attacks to travel via a [[cryptoworm]]. 

[[Cryptoworms]] are a recent form of computer virus that can travel between computers using networks, exploiting [[TCP]] [[port]] 445). To be infected, there is no need to click on a bad link - the malware can spread autonomously, from a computer to a connected printer, and then beyond to adjacent computers, via [[WIFI]], [[ethernet]], etc. 

The port 445 vulnerability allowed the malware to move freely across intranets, and infect thousands of computers rapidly. The Wannacry attack was one of the first large scale uses of a [[cryptoworm]].

## January 2021 attacks targeting cybersecurity researchers

In January 2021, [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] both publicly reported on a group of North Korean hackers targeting cybersecurity researchers via a [[social engineering]] campaign, with [[Microsoft]] specifically attributing the campaign to Lazarus Group.

The hackers created multiple user profiles on [[Twitter]], [[GitHub]], and [[LinkedIn]] posing as legitimate software vulnerability researchers, and used those profiles to interact with posts and content made by others in the security research community. The [[hacker]]s would then target specific security researchers by contacting them directly with an offer to collaborate on research, with the goal of getting the victim to download a file containing malware, or to visit a blog post on a website controlled by the hackers.

Some victims who visited the blog post reported that their computers were compromised despite using fully patched versions of the Google Chrome browser, suggesting that the hackers may have used a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability affecting Chrome for the attack; however, Google stated that they were unable to confirm the exact method of compromise at the time of the report.
