A **black hat** (**black hat hacker** or **blackhat**) is a computer [[hacker]] who violates laws or typical ethical standards for nefarious purposes, such as [[cybercrime]], [[cyberwarfare]] or malice.

The Hat term originates from 1950s westerns, when bad guys typically wore black hats and good guys white hats. A black hat is contrasted with a [[white hat]]. Additionally, there is a third category which is called a [[grey hat]], a person who hacks with good intentions but sometimes without permission
